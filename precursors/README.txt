The .wav files included here are meant for audio testing only and
are intended to be bundled into the final distribution. Developers
who want to use this for testing will need to manually stage and load
these samples into the correct location in the FLASH. See 
https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/master/docs/flash.md
for the locations of the samples, and the betrusted-scripts repo
for any helper scripts to do this.

The track samples included here are from "Midwinter", by
